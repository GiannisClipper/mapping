Mapping application is developed for practicing and educative purposes. The code is written in ReactJS and pure javascript and makes use of OpenStreetMap throught LeafletJS library. The aim of this application is to provide a cloud platform where registered users can produce their own mappings, either for private usage or to be visible to anyone visiting the site of the application.

A map should have a title, optionally a description and a definition as published (visible to anyone) or not. A number of lines and points can be placed over the map, each one with it's own title and description as well as in variable colors and sizes. It's also can be defined the initial center and zoom level of the map representation.

There is a demo deployment, where anyone can view the available mapping samples or even signin as guest (username: guest, password: guest) and modify existing or create new mappings. Keep in mind that it is a demo and the data not stored. Actually are temporarily stored in browser's localstorage and getting removed on signin and signout operations.
